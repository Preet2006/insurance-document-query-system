## ðŸš€ Submission Steps

### Step 1: Test Your API
```bash
# Start your API
cd backend
python app.py

# Test in another terminal
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Files
Create a zip file containing:
```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingest.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (your insurance documents)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ API_DOCUMENTATION.md
â””â”€â”€ SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md
```

### Step 3: Final Testing
Test these scenarios:
1. **Health Check**: `GET /health`
2. **Single Query**: `POST /query` with insurance question
3. **Batch Query**: `POST /batch_query` with multiple questions
4. **Error Handling**: Send invalid JSON to test error responses

### Step 4: Submission Format
Depending on the evaluation platform, you may need to:

1. **Upload files directly**: Zip your project folder
2. **Git repository**: Push to GitHub and provide the link
3. **Deploy online**: Deploy to a cloud service and provide the URL
4. **API endpoint**: Provide the running API URL if deployed

## ðŸ“‹ Required Information for Submission

### Basic Information
- **Project Name**: Insurance Policy Analysis API
- **Description**: AI-powered insurance policy document analysis
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, ChromaDB, Gemini API
- **Main Features**: Semantic search, multi-model LLM, batch processing

### API Details
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5001` (or your deployed URL)
- **Endpoints**: 4 endpoints (health, query, batch_query, feedback)
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Response Format**: JSON

### Testing Information
- **Test Questions**: Provided in documentation
- **Expected Responses**: Sample responses included
- **Performance**: 1-3 seconds average response time

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues to Check

### Before Submission
1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure port 5001 is available
2. **Dependencies**: All packages installed correctly
3. **API keys**: Gemini and Cohere API keys are configured
4. **Documents**: Insurance documents are properly ingested
5. **Memory**: Sufficient RAM for model loading

### During Testing
1. **CORS issues**: API should accept requests from any origin
2. **Timeout issues**: Responses should come within 30 seconds
3. **Memory leaks**: API should handle multiple requests without crashing
4. **Error messages**: Should be clear and helpful

## ðŸ“ž Support Information

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure API keys are valid
4. Test with simple queries first
5. Check if documents are properly ingested

## ðŸŽ¯ Evaluation Criteria

Your API will likely be evaluated on:
- **Functionality**: Does it work as expected?
- **Documentation**: Is it clear and complete?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured?
- **Performance**: Does it respond quickly?
- **Error Handling**: Does it handle errors gracefully?
- **Innovation**: Does it solve the problem effectively?
