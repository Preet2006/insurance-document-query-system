# LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System for Insurance Documents

## Problem Statement Solution

This system implements an intelligent query-retrieval system that can process large insurance documents and make contextual decisions in real-time. The system handles PDFs, DOCX files, and provides structured JSON responses for insurance policy queries.

## System Architecture

### 1. Input Documents Processing
- **Runtime Document Processing**: Documents are downloaded from URLs at runtime
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, DOCX, and plain text files
- **Text Extraction**: Robust extraction with OCR fallback for scanned documents

### 2. LLM Parser & Query Understanding
- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligent document segmentation based on paragraphs and sentences
- **Keyword Expansion**: Insurance-specific terminology expansion for better matching
- **Query Analysis**: Enhanced understanding of insurance-related questions

### 3. Embedding Search & Retrieval
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with SentenceTransformer embeddings (BGE-small-en-v1.5)
- **Semantic Search**: Cosine similarity-based retrieval
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines semantic similarity with keyword matching

### 4. Clause Matching & Evidence Retrieval
- **Multi-strategy Retrieval**: 
  - Semantic similarity scoring
  - Insurance-specific keyword matching
  - Section-based relevance scoring
- **Evidence Optimization**: Smart chunk selection for maximum relevance

### 5. Logic Evaluation & Decision Processing
- **Multi-LLM Fallback**: Gemini → Cohere → Mistral for reliability
- **Structured Prompts**: Expert insurance analyst prompts for accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Built-in confidence assessment

### 6. JSON Output Generation
- **Structured Responses**: Exact format matching hackathon requirements
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple questions efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error reporting

## API Endpoint

### POST /hackrx/run

**Request Format:**
```json
{
    "documents": "https://example.com/policy.pdf",
    "questions": [
        "What is the grace period for premium payment?",
        "Does this policy cover maternity expenses?",
        "What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases?"
    ]
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
    "answers": [
        "A grace period of thirty days is provided for premium payment after the due date.",
        "Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses with specific conditions.",
        "There is a waiting period of thirty-six months for pre-existing diseases."
    ]
}
```
